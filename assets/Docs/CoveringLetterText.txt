Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I am writing to express my interest in a programming position at [Company Name]. With six years of experience in the video game industry across two companies and multiple projects, I bring a solid foundation in C++ and a broad technical skill set that allows me to contribute meaningfully across various domains of game development.

As a generalist programmer, I’ve worked on everything from gameplay systems to engine-level architecture and performance optimization. This versatility has made me comfortable adapting to new challenges and working effectively within cross-disciplinary teams. I am passionate about writing high-quality, maintainable code and continuously evolving my craft to meet the demands of complex and scalable game systems.

Beyond my core programming skills, I’m particularly drawn to projects that push the boundaries of what games can do—both technically and creatively. On my last project at MPG, I developed a dynamic tinting system that allowed any object in the scene to be recolored in real time, adding a unique interactive layer to gameplay. Currently, I’m developing a template that integrates real-world geographic data, such as elevation maps and city layouts, to procedurally generate immersive game worlds based on actual locations.

I would be excited for the opportunity to bring this experience and passion to the innovative work being done at [Company Name]. I’ve long admired [something specific about the company or a recent project], and I’d love to contribute to [a goal or value you share with them].

Thank you for considering my application. I’ve attached my resume and would be happy to provide any further information or code samples upon request. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
