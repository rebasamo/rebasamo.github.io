# Context

Group of different exercises to learn and experience different ways of optimizing code. They consist to identify the hotspot of the algorithm, understand what it does and optimize it to the most.

All the work and tests were made on a Raspberry Pi 3 model b with its processor limited to 600 Hz.

# Knowledge Adquired

- Identify the HotSpot using debugging tools if needed.
- Understand what the code does and which parts could be optimized or even discarded.
- Programming using ARM-ASM
  - Basic instructions
  - Floating Point instructions
- Programming using Fixed-Point integers and his benefits.
