# About Me
<font style="opacity: 0.5" size= "3">
Young programmer on the way of refine my programming abilities as well as forging news ones on the way. Very interested on the procedural code as well as instancing. Something between Minecraft and Cube World would be the environment I would like to reproduce in a hand made engine as I am learning. Generate a procedural terrain, handle the information of the world, discard the unnecesary information and render all with the best perfomance possible are some of the main features I want to learn.

<br>

Looking for work, if possible, in a company with games with those characteristics where to learn in depth every nook of the algorithms.

<br>
<br>

I become easily immersed in a piece of code until it results in what I am searching for which is on of my strengths.
